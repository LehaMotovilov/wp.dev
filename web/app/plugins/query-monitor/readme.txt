== Description ==

Query Monitor is a debugging plugin for anyone developing with WordPress. It has some advanced features not available in other debugging plugins, including automatic AJAX debugging, REST API debugging, and the ability to narrow down things by plugin or theme.

For complete information, please see [Query Monitor's GitHub repo](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor).

Here's an overview of what's shown:

= Database Queries =

 * Shows all database queries performed on the current page
 * Shows **affected rows** and time for all queries
 * Show notifications for **slow queries** and **queries with errors**
 * Filter queries by **query type** (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc)
 * Filter queries by **component** (WordPress core, Plugin X, Plugin Y, theme)
 * Filter queries by **calling function**
 * View **aggregate query information** grouped by component, calling function, and type
 * Super advanced: Supports **multiple instances of wpdb** on one page (more info in the FAQ)

Filtering queries by component or calling function makes it easy to see which plugins, themes, or functions on your site are making the most (or the slowest) database queries.

= Hooks =

 * Shows all hooks fired on the current page, along with hooked actions, their priorities, and their components
 * Filter hooks by **part of their name**
 * Filter actions by **component** (WordPress core, Plugin X, Plugin Y, theme)

= Theme =

 * Shows the **template filename** for the current page
 * Shows the available **body classes** for the current page
 * Shows the active theme name

= PHP Errors =

 * PHP errors (warnings, notices, stricts, and deprecated) are presented nicely along with their component and call stack
 * Shows an easily visible warning in the admin toolbar

= Request =

 * Shows **matched rewrite rules** and associated query strings
 * Shows **query vars** for the current request, and highlights **custom query vars**
 * Shows the **queried object** details
 * Shows details of the **current blog** (multisite only) and **current site** (multi-network only)

= Rewrite Rules =

 * Shows **all matching rewrite rules** for a given request

= Scripts & Styles =

 * Shows all **enqueued scripts and styles** on the current page, along with their URL and version
 * Shows their **dependencies and dependents**, and alerts you to any **broken dependencies**

= Languages =

 * Shows you **language settings** and text domains
 * Shows you the **MO files** for each text domain and which ones were loaded or not

= HTTP Requests =

 * Shows all HTTP requests performed on the current page (as long as they use WordPress' HTTP API)
 * Shows the response code, call stack, transport, component, timeout, and time taken
 * Highlights **erroneous responses**, such as failed requests and anything without a `200` response code

= Redirects =

 * Whenever a redirect occurs, Query Monitor adds an `X-QM-Redirect` HTTP header containing the call stack, so you can use your favourite HTTP inspector or browser developer tools to easily trace where a redirect has come from

= AJAX =

The response from any jQuery AJAX request on the page will contain various debugging information in its headers. Any errors also get output to the developer console. **No hooking required**.

Currently this includes PHP errors and some overview information such as memory usage, but this will be built upon in future versions.

= REST API =

The response from an authenticated WordPress REST API (v2 or later) request will contain various debugging information in its headers, as long as the authenticated user has permission to view Query Monitor's output.

Currently this includes PHP errors and some overview information such as memory usage, but this will be built upon in future versions.

= Admin Screen =

 * Shows the correct names for **custom column filters and actions** on all admin screens that have a listing table
 * Shows the state of `get_current_screen()` and a few variables

= Environment Information =

 * Shows **various PHP information** such as memory limit and error reporting levels
 * Highlights the fact when any of these are overridden at runtime
 * Shows **various MySQL information**, including caching and performance related configuration
 * Highlights the fact when any performance related configurations are not optimal
 * Shows various details about **WordPress** and the **web server**
 * Shows version numbers for all the things

= Everything Else =

 * Shows any **transients that were set**, along with their timeout, component, and call stack
 * Shows all **WordPress conditionals** on the current page, highlighted nicely
 * Shows an overview at the top, including page generation time and memory limit as absolute values and as % of their respective limits

= Authentication =

By default, Query Monitor's output is only shown to Administrators on single-site installs, and Super Admins on Multisite installs.

In addition to this, you can set an authentication cookie which allows you to view Query Monitor output when you're not logged in (or if you're logged in as a non-administrator). See the bottom of Query Monitor's output for details.

== Installation ==

Install Query Monitor just like any other plugin.

If you don't know how to do that, then Query Monitor is not for you.

== Screenshots ==

1. The admin toolbar menu showing an overview
2. Aggregate database queries by component
3. Slow database queries highlighted in a separate panel
4. Database queries complete with filter controls
5. Hooks and actions
6. HTTP requests (showing an HTTP error)
7. Aggregate database queries grouped by calling function

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can see Query Monitor's output? =

By default, Query Monitor's output is only shown to Administrators on single-site installs, and Super Admins on Multisite installs.

In addition to this, you can set an authentication cookie which allows you to view Query Monitor output when you're not logged in (or if you're logged in as a non-administrator). See the bottom of Query Monitor's output for details.

= Does Query Monitor itself impact the page generation time or memory usage? =

Short answer: Yes, but only a little.

Long answer: Query Monitor has a small impact on page generation time because it hooks into a few places in WordPress in the same way that other plugins do. The impact is negligible.

On pages that have an especially high number of database queries (in the hundreds), Query Monitor currently uses more memory than I would like it to. This is due to the amount of data that is captured in the stack trace for each query. I have been and will be working to continually reduce this.

= Are there any add-on plugins for Query Monitor? =

[A list of add-on plugins for Query Monitor can be found here.](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/wiki/Query-Monitor-Add-on-Plugins)

In addition, Query Monitor transparently supports add-ons for the Debug Bar plugin. If you have any Debug Bar add-ons installed, just deactivate Debug Bar and the add-ons will show up in Query Monitor's menu.

= Where can I suggest a new feature or report a bug? =

Please use [the issue tracker on Query Monitor's GitHub repo](https://github.com/johnbillion/query-monitor/issues) as it's easier to keep track of issues there, rather than on the wordpress.org support forums.

= Is Query Monitor available on WordPress.com VIP Go? =

Yep! You just need to add `define( 'WPCOM_VIP_QM_ENABLE', true );` to your `vip-config/vip-config.php` file.

(It's not available on standard WordPress.com VIP though.)

= I'm using multiple instances of `wpdb`. How do I get my additional instances to show up in Query Monitor? =

You'll need to hook into the `qm/collect/db_objects` filter and add an item to the array with your connection name as the key and the `wpdb` instance as the value. Your `wpdb` instance will then show up as a separate panel, and the query time and query count will show up separately in the admin toolbar menu. Aggregate information (queries by caller and component) will not be separated.

= Do you accept donations? =

No, I do not accept donations. If you like the plugin, I'd love for you to [leave a review](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/query-monitor). Tell all your friends about the plugin too!
