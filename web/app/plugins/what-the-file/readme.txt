What The File is the best tool to find out what template parts are used to display the page you're currently viewing!

== Description ==

What The File adds an option to your toolbar showing what file and template parts are used to display the page you're currently viewing. You can click the file name to directly edit it through the theme editor, though I don't recommend this for bigger changes. What The File supports BuddyPress and Roots Theme based themes.

More information can be found <a href='http://www.barrykooij.com/what-the-file/'>here</a>.
For support please visit the <a href='http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/what-the-file'>Support forum</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `what-the-file` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

In the toolbar you will find the "What The File" option. Hovering this option will display the currently used template file, clicking the template file name will allow you to edit the template file with the WordPress file editor. Please note that some BuddyPress files can't be edited in the WordPress editor.
